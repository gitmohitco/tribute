                MS Dhoni probably ranks as the third-most popular Indian cricketer ever, behind only Sachin Tendulkar
                and Virat Kohli. He emerged from a cricketing backwater, the eastern Indian state of Jharkhand, and made
                it to the top with a home-made batting and wicketkeeping technique, and a style of captaincy that scaled
                the highs and hit the lows of both conservatism and unorthodoxy.
            </q>
        </em>
        </p><br>
        <p>
            Under Dhoni's leadership, India won the top prize in all formats: leading the Test rankings for 18 months
            starting December 2009, winning the 50-over World Cup in 2011, and the T20 world title on his captaincy
            debut in 2007.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            He seemingly emerged fully formed at 23, when he blasted two centuries in a triangular 50-over tournament
            for India A in Nairobi. Long-haired and fearless, he soon swaggered into international cricket, and became
            an instant darling of the crowds with ODI innings of 148 and 183 not out within a year of his debut.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            Dhoni improvised abd learned, but he didn't apologise for his batting style, which was not the most elegant.
            He became a multifaceted ODI batter, one who could accumulate, rebuild, and unleash big sixes, all seemingly
            at will.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            Along the way he showed leadership skills, which were recognised when Rahul Dravid gave up the captaincy in
        2007. A day before that announcement from Dravid, a young India side under Dhoni played the first game of the
        first T20 World Cup in South Africa, and went on to win the tournament. The ODI captaincy was a natural
        progression, and the Test role duly followed too.

            Dhoni brought to the captaincy a thick skin and the relative indifference to results that an Indian captain needs to keep the job for long. Along with India's coach, Gary Kirsten, he put his senior performers in a comfortable place, and they repaid him by producing some of their best years in international cricket. Dhoni's sense of calm on the field mostly worked like a charm in the shorter formats, although he sometimes sat back for too long in Tests tactically. Still, India had some of their best years in Test cricket, in terms of tangible achievement, under him: in the 60 Tests he led in, they had a win-loss ratio of 1.5.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            However, after the 50-over World Cup win in 2011, which Dhoni sealed with a timely 91 and a six off his patented helicopter shot, an ageing team lost eight straight Tests on the trot away from home and his captaincy came under immense pressure, which was then exacerbated by India's first home series loss in eight years, 2-1 to England in 2012-13. This brought about a new chapter in Dhoni's career, where he seemed more assertive as a captain, building a new team. He played his best Test innings on a turner to win India the Chennai Test in 2013 against Australia, and became the first captain to lead India to four wins in a Test series.
        </p>
        <p>
            Away from home in the winter of 2013-14, India lost Test series in South Africa and New Zealand by 1-0 margins that did not reflect how close they came to winning both. The England tour of 2014 began promisingly, with a drawn first Test followed by a historic win at Lord's, but India crashed to earth immediately afterwards to lose the series 3-1. At Old Trafford and The Oval, with the batting crumbling around him, Dhoni played a couple of his bravest innings in Tests.
